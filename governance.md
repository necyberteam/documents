### Code of Conduct

The US-RSE Association requires all members to adhere to the
[US-RSE Code of Conduct](https://us-rse.org/code-of-conduct/) in all US-RSE activities, forums,
and communications.

### Membership

Membership is open to anyone who supports the mission of the US-RSE Association and who agrees to abide by
the US-RSE Association Code of Conduct. As stated in our Code of Conduct, we welcome and encourage
members regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or national and ethnic origin.

Individuals may apply for membership by submitting the required [membership
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJbPczGHFN8mfMFu_YQym508OzFtOZxfSzr1sOoINxaMmiaw/viewform).
Applications from people who currently have membership status revoked or applications that are found

US-RSE communication channels.

Members are considered in “good standing” if they have supplied correct membership information
during their application and are not subject to any form of sanction, suspension or disciplinary
censure.

### Voting

When electing Steering Committee members, or when other membership elections take place, each US-RSE
member in good standing will be entitled to one vote.

### Steering Committee Roles and Number

The Steering Committee consists of nine seats.

The Steering Committee has the following roles:

* The Steering Committee is responsible for setting the overall policy and direction of the US-RSE
  Association, based on the inputs of the US-RSE Association membership.
* The Steering Committee is ultimately responsible for day-to-day activities, operations, and
  development, but many of these actions and activities will be initiated, organized, and managed by
  community committees and members at large.
* Members of the Steering Committee have the ability to grant or remove administrative rights for
  US-RSE Association umbrella technologies including but not limited to:
    * All repositories in the US-RSE GitHub organization
    * All mailboxes and mailing lists associated with the us-rse.org domain name
    * The us-rse.org domain and website
    * The US-RSE slack channel
    * Any other official accounts intended to represent the overall organization, now or in the
      future (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)

The Steering Committee strives for consensus in its decisions. In the case of a dispute or argument
within the community, a majority vote of all of the Steering Committee members will result in a
final decision. In the event of a tie, the Steering Committee chair will cast the deciding vote.  At
all Committee meetings, a quorum is at least one half of the members.

### Steering Committee Elections and Terms

After the conclusion of the founding Steering Committee's tenure, all future Steering Committee
members will be elected by the general US-RSE membership.  Steering committee members are elected to
a 2-year term. To provide continuity, steering committee members will have staggered terms, with
four or five members elected each year.

Nominations for open positions will be solicited from all members at least 6 weeks before the
election.  The list of nominated candidates will be announced at least 3 weeks before the election.
All US-RSE members in good standing on the date that the nominations are opened are eligible to be
nominated as candidates.

### Steering Committee Meetings and Communication

Steering Committee meetings will take place at a minimum of once per quarter, and typically will be
held monthly. All Steering Committee meetings will have notes recorded and made available to the
US-RSE Association members. The tallies of any votes of the Steering Committee will also be made
available.

### Steering Committee Officers

Officers consist of a Chair, a Vice-Chair, an Election Chair, a Treasurer, and a Secretary, elected by the Steering
Committee. Officer elections will be held at the meeting following the election of new members to
the Steering Committee.

#### Chair

The Chair will set the agenda and preside over Steering Committee meetings or arrange for the Vice-
Chair or another Steering Committee member to do so.

#### Vice-Chair

In the event of the absence of the Chair, the Vice-Chair will preside at meetings. The Vice-Chair
will be responsible for ensuring the community is kept informed of Association activities through
regular newsletters, social media posts, etc. In addition, the Vice-Chair will annually prepare a
report of Association activities in the past year.

#### Election Chair

The Election Chair will be responsible for collecting nominations for Steering Committee elections,
running such elections, and running other votes of the membership as required. The Election Chair
will be filled by a Steering Committee member in the first year of their term for a duration of 1
year.

#### Treasurer

The Treasurer will be responsible for the finances of the US-RSE Association. The Treasurer will present an
overall budget for approval by the Steering Committee in advance of the Annual General Meeting, and
then present this budget to the US-RSE membership in the Annual General Meeting.
The Treasurer additionally has the authority to authorize spending (as previously approved in the budget)
of US-RSE funds held by our Fiscal Sponsor, as do the Chair and Vice-Chair.

#### Secretary

The Secretary will be responsible for ensuring that notes are taken in each meeting of the Committee
and published after the meeting. In the absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer of the
meeting will appoint another member to take on this responsibility.

### Resignations

A Steering Committee member may choose to resign by informing the Steering Committee Chair via
email.  Additionally, the Steering Committee Chair can resign by informing the full committee via
email. The resignation will take effect at the time specified in the notice, and, unless otherwise
specified, formal acceptance of the resignation is not necessary.

### Removal

Steering Committee members can be removed by a two-thirds (⅔) vote of the full Steering Committee.
In the event that that Committee is considering the removal of the Chair, the Vice-Chair will
preside.

### Vacancies

If a seat on the Steering Committee becomes vacant, the remaining members of the Steering Committee
may choose to appoint someone to fill the position for the remainder of the term. If the Steering
Committee chooses to fill the position, the replacement will be chosen by a majority vote of the
remaining members of the Steering Committee.  In the event that a majority vote cannot be achieved,
the seat shall remain open until the end of the seat's term.

## Committees, Working Groups, and Community Involvement

Organizational functions of the US-RSE Association will be managed by standing committees that may
consist of one or more members of the Steering Committee and interested members of and participants in
the Association. These organizational activities include communications (website, social media,
etc.), conference planning, and others to be determined by the Steering Committee.

Other activities, events, and efforts that have a fixed end date will be managed by working groups.
These working groups can and should be initiated by members at large through discussion with the
Steering Committee to ensure alignment with US-RSE priorities.  Working groups should have at least
three (3) US-RSE members as participants.

## Changes to Governance

Minor revisions to this document can be made with the approval of at least two-thirds (⅔) of the current
steering committee members. Major changes to the governance structure or this document will require
a vote of the membership directly.
